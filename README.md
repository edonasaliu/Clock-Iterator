# Python Queue Implementations and ClockIterator

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets and explanations related to queue data structures and an implementation of a clock iterator.

## Activities

### 1. Clock Iterator Implementation

The ClockIterator is a custom Python iterator that simulates a 24-hour digital clock. It outputs the time in a loop from 00:00 to 23:59 and then starts over.

### 2. Queue Types Explanation

We discuss the differences between three types of queues:

- **Queue**: A standard FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.
- **PriorityQueue**: A queue that sorts items by a designated priority.
- **LifoQueue**: A stack-like queue that processes items in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order.

### 3. Queue Implementations Unit Testing

We provide unit tests for the ClockIterator class to demonstrate the importance of testing in software development. Additionally, we explore how the Queue class in Python serves as a template for creating specialized queue types like PriorityQueue and LifoQueue.

## Conclusion

These activities are designed to provide a practical understanding of Python's queue module, the concept of iterators, and the importance of unit testing in software development.
